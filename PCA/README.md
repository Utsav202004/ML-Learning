This is my implementation of the PCA on a data i fabricated myself, and trying to resemble it to the real world randomness.

This is from the lecture series: 100 Days of Machine Learning by CampusX on youtube but has additions like: What troubled me while learning and what was output. Also i have used new libraries for the depreceated ones.

Also i have added the use of PCA using inbuilt scikit library. There are different visualisations and techniques that i have used to visualise how PCA is working and affecting the speed and computations.I have done it on the Mnist dataset.
