This is my implementation of the Multivariate Impuatation using Chained Equations, a imputation technique.

This is made while learning from the lecture series 100 Days of Machine Learning by CampusX on youtube.

Although there are multiple modification for self learning, i have done multiple manual iterations which may seem non productive, but i am just a beginner currently and trying to get hands on with the features and code part.

I could also have make a function for finding the next iteration but again, i preferred this just to get the feel of the topic.
